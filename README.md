# Barter Pay Project

## Overview

Barter Pay is a legal payment tender designed to facilitate cashless transactions, manage inflation, and prevent fraud, robberies, and more. Goods are bought and held as virtual items, traded peer-to-peer, or redeemed for credits as specified by the company.

## Goals

1. **Foster Cashless Transactions:**
   - Overcome physical constraints like distance, storage, and time by allowing goods to be bought and held as virtual items.

2. **Inflation Management:**
   - Enable users to purchase items at a fixed price and redeem them when storage becomes available or the redeemable time approaches.

3. **Prevent Fraud, Robberies, and More:**
   - Enhance security and reduce physical threats associated with traditional transactions by operating in a virtual environment.
